Reproducible science with Binder
================================

The `PDF <MCToolKit_Binder.pdf>`_
of the presentation given on December 1, 2020 at the Mardi Caf√© is provided in
this repo. 

The link to the Github repo and Binderhub used in the presentation are `here
<https://github.com/roxyboy/SouthernOcean-ARGO>`_. 
(Disclaimer: Due to sloppy
version control, there are two minor edits needed in the notebook when running
them on Binder, `let me know <https://github.com/roxyboy/SouthernOcean-ARGO/issues>`_ if you try it out and face an issue.)
