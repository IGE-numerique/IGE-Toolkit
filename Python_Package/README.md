# How to make a Python package

Presented by [Clara Burgard](https://claraburgard.weebly.com/) on 09/02/2021

This presentation is a step-by-step tutorial for creating a Python package from a set of python functions. It describes some steps from my own experience of making
a Python package so it does not necessarily contain everything that can be done.
