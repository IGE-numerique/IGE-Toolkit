### Present your work
-


The goal is to present a tool and exchange with others + know who to ask when we need help.


## Contacts for proposing new topics:
- thomas.chauve@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr

PS: you can also make directly a pull request on this file in the *Possible unplanned meetings* section or use directly the Slack #machine-learning channel to contact us. We will then add you as a contributor so that you can share some code.
