## Next meetings ([calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/qtf92ferc1tf5knsqjoptqv498%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)):
- Tuesday XX/XX at 10:30 am : Machine learning #2: Presentation of a ML probleme from scratch ([Clara Burgard](https://claraburgard.weebly.com/))

## Possible next meetings / Topic:
-

## Past meetings:

- Tuesday 11/05 at 10:30 am: Machine learning #1: Creation of a new discussion group within MCToolkit, first meeting (Thomas Chauve)

## Here are some ideas of topics/tools to talk about:

### Methods
- Tree base machine learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boost)
- Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

### Environement
- [scikit-learn framework](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [TensorFlow framework](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [pyTorch framework](https://pytorch.org/)
- [pySindy](https://github.com/dynamicslab/pysindy)

### Explainable AI
- [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
- [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)
- [Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html#sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV)
- [Permutation Importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance.html#sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance)

### Paper discussion
- [Padarian et al. 2020 - Game theory interpretation of digital soil mapping convolutional neural networks](https://soil.copernicus.org/articles/6/389/2020/)
- [Valmonte Riel et al. 2021 - Data-Driven Inference of the Mechanics of Slip Along Glacier Beds Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.31223/X52C8V)

### Present your work
-


The goal is to present a tool and exchange with others + know who to ask when we need help.
